# Duplicate Tab - An Epiphany Extension
Create a new tab with the url and history of the current one.

This extension was created in an effort to alleviate the burden of foresight required to identify when you want to follow a link in a new tab as opposed to the current tab.  If it happens that you want to retain your tab state, but continue browsing, just duplicate the tab!

## Installation
Download the extension zip file from the downloads section, and extract the contents into ~/.gnome2/epiphany/extensions .  Then, in Epiphany, select Tools->Extensions from the menu.  Select the "Duplicate a tab" extension.

That's it!  Press Shift+Ctrl+D to duplicate the current tab (or select Tabs->Duplicate Tab from the menu).
